    <figcaption>Here we bring you a classic breakfast of blueberry waffles with maple butter. You can’t beat these, cooked until golden, and sprinkled with cinnamon. Plus, if you don’t have a waffle iron, you can use a griddle pan and still come up trumps!
        Or why not try our coconut and banana waffles for something a bit different?</figcaption>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>175g plain flour</li>
            <li>¼ tsp bicarb soda</li>
            <li>½ tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1 tbsp icing sugar</li>
            <li>1 tsp ground cinnamon, plus extra to serve</li>
            <li>300ml buttermilk</li>
            <li>50ml whole milk</li>
            <li>50g unsalted butter, melted and cooled, plus extra to grease</li>
            <li>2 medium free-range eggs, separated</li>
            <li>300g blueberries</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>For the whipped maple butter</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>150g unsalted butter</li>
            <li>4 tbsp maple syrup, plus extra to serve</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>You'll also need</h3>
        <ul><li>A waffle iron or ridged griddle pan</li></ul>

    <h2>Method</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>For the whipped butter, melt the butter in a small pan over a medium heat. Continue to cook, stirring regularly, until the butter turns brown and smells nutty. Pour into a bowl and add the maple syrup, then chill until the butter re-solidifies but is still soft (about 30 minutes). Beat the butter using an electric hand mixer until very pale and fluffy. Stir in a pinch of sea salt, then set aside at room temperature until ready to serve.</li>
        <br><li>Grease an 18cm waffle iron (see Know-how) and heat to high. Sift the flour, bicarb, baking powder, icing sugar and cinnamon together in a large bowl. In another bowl, whisk the buttermilk, milk, butter and egg yolks, then pour into the dry ingredients and mix until just combined.</li>
        <br><li>Whisk the egg whites to firm peaks using an electric hand mixer, then fold into the waffle batter, followed by half the blueberries. Ladle about ¼ of the batter into the middle of the waffle iron and cook for 6-8 minutes until crisp and golden. Keep the cooked waffles warm in a low oven while cooking the remaining batter.</li>
        <br><li>Serve the waffles warm, topped with the maple butter, remaining fresh blueberries, an extra drizzle of maple syrup and a sprinkling of cinnamon, if you like.</li>
