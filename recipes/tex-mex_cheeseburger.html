Put over a medium heat and bring it to the boil (whisking all the time), then simmer for 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the cheese, chilli powder, garlic and onion powders, and a pinch of salt. If the cheese isn’t fully melted, gently warm over a low heat until silky smooth. Adjust the thickness with a little more evaporated milk if needed. Keep warm until ready to serve.      </li>
        <br><li>Heat a ridged griddle pan, heavy-bottomed frying pan or prepare a barbecue for high direct heat. Brush the burgers with oil and sprinkle with the fajita seasoning. Cook for 6-8 minutes until cooked through and well browned.</li>
        <br><li>While the burgers are cooking, toss together the cabbage, carrot, coriander, onion, mayo and lime zest and juice in a bowl. Season with salt and a little pepper.</li>
        <br><li>Spread the burger buns with a dollop of ketchup, then pile on the slaw. Top each bun with a cooked burger patty then pour over a generous helping of the cheese sauce. Finish with a few slices of pickled jalapeño and pop the bun lid on. Serve immediately.</li>
