    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>800g free-range pork shoulder, cut into 3-4cm chunks</li>
            <li>2 red onions, chopped</li>
            <li>4 peeled garlic cloves, bashed with the side of a cook’s knife</li>
            <li>1 tbsp ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 tbsp ground coriander</li>
            <li>½ tsp chilli powder</li>
            <li>½ tsp bell pepper flakes or ground paprika</li>            
            <li>½ tsp ground allspice</li>
            <li>2 tsp dried oregano</li>
            <li>4 tbsp tomato purée</li>
            <li>4 tbsp red wine vinegar</li>
            <li>400g tin chopped tomatoes</li>
            <li>A few coriander sprigs and lime wedges to serve</li>
            <li>Tabasco or other hot sauce to serve (if you like things spicy)</li>

        </ul>
   
    <h2>Method</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Add all the ingredients (except the coriander, limes and Tabasco), some salt and pepper and 100ml water to your slow cooker and cook on low for 6 hours, or on high for 4 hours. There’s no need to stir the pork while it’s cooking so you can go out and leave it simmering (see Know-how below for how to cook it in a regular oven).</li>
        <br><li>Once the cooking time is up, check the seasoning then, using 2 forks, shred the meat to ‘pull’ it. Serve sprinkled with the coriander, with lime wedges for squeezing, hot sauce, if you like, and rice, as a jacket potato topper or in a Tex-Mex pasta bake.</li>
       </ol>

        <legend>Batch cook:</legend>
        <p>Cool the pork completely, then portion into lidded freezerproof containers and freeze for up to 3 months. Defrost in the fridge overnight, then reheat in a pan on the hob until piping hot. Leftovers will keep in a lidded container in the fridge for up to 5 days </p>
